### Why the Hate?
Avocado smoothies improve your health. So why do **so many** people look at me with disgust and confusion when I order one at the _local Pho Tasty Restaurant_ in Cerritos? Is it that big of a deal? After much scientific research, contemplation, and more, I have concluded three main reasons why people are such haters of avocado smoothies. 
1. The color green throws them off. Green smoothies are associated with kale smoothies (disgusting) but avocado smoothies are **way better.**
2. Avocado and smoothies just don't seem to _mix_ well for the common person. These people just have not been enlightened by avocado smoothie's flavor and texture.
3. People are just avocado **HATERS**
