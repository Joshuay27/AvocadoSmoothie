### Why the Hate?
Avocado smoothies improve your health. So why do **so many** people look at me with disgust and confusion when I order one at the _[local Pho Tasty Restaurant](https://photastyartesia.com/menu/)_ in Cerritos? Is it that big of a deal? After much scientific research, contemplation, and more, I have concluded three main reasons why people are such haters of avocado smoothies. 
1. The color green throws them off. Green smoothies are associated with kale smoothies (disgusting) but avocado smoothies are **way better.**
2. Avocado and smoothies just don't seem to _mix_ well for the common person. These people just have not been enlightened by avocado smoothie's flavor and texture.
3. People are just avocado **HATERS**

### Just One Sip...
All it takes is one sip for you to be completely enlightened by the wonderful taste of avocado smoothies. You **NEED** to try avocado smoothies. 
### Future Goals:
I hope that one day, I can create a society that does not shame avocado smoothie drinkers, but everyone becomes avocado smoothie enjoyers and drink avocado smoothies just as frequently as water. #Avocadosmoothiegang4life
